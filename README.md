# Notes

you can run the aplication using 
```
node dest/app 
npm start
```
either of those will work

Remember that you must configure the environment variables,  I leave an example file for you to configure yourself.

# if you can find an error or bug, please send it to this email: jorgeivancvcontact@gmail.com

You can see the application working in heroku, although to get all the juice you should make the requests by postman, or some other specialized application to test all the routes it has:
https://restfulservercompleted.herokuapp.com

see the documentation of all the routes that this application has:
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16563393/UV5c9vFg

In the files, googleLogin, loginNormal and register you will have to change the url of heroku to the domain in which you upload the application, or also the port of the localhost, the default is 8080.
